# TransitXpress_Travel-with-us_Python

This is a Pyhton-based GUI application where different libraries are used to build this application. TransitXpress is a local bus information application traveling in the city(Kolhapur, Sangli, Jaysingour, Sanjay Ghodawat University, Ichalkarnji). As there is no such application for MSRTC local bus for local everyday traveling people and college students this application will help with Bus time, name, ticket, etc. This whole application is built using PyQt5 and Excel for bus information. Thank You ðŸ¤˜
